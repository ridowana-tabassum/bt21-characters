# bt21-characters
For my computer graphics course, I needed to complete a basic project. It entails creating drawings of the BTS members' BT21 characters. The 2D framework of the BT21 Characters (Tata, RJ, Shooky, and Koya) provides fundamental functionalities including moving object, continuous moving object, and static object.
